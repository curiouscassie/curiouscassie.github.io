The discoveries led by the scientists of our past and present continue to inspire us. These folks are curious and passionate about their pursuit. They are also fearless in asking questions.</p><p>In fact, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein>Albert Einstein</a>, one of the great scientists of all time, once said,</p><blockquote><p>I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious!</p></blockquote><p>The <a href=https://curiouscassie.github.io/#author>contributors of the Curious Cassie books</a> aim to tell you all about the great things our scientists discovered and invented through a series of fascinating tales! Both Suneeta and Jaya, the author and illustrator respectively, feel the need for more books that spark curiosity in the kids and encourage them to ask questions and follow through with their quests. Being closely connected to science and engineering, they feel perhaps there are better ways to get our younger 6-8 age kids to start thinking about STEM and being inspired by great scientists and philosophers of all times.</p><p>The Curious Cassie book series aims to address that. Cassie, a 6-year-old kid, is also passionately curious and not scared of asking questions! Every book in this series is devoted to a scientist whose discoveries are canvassed through fun and engaging conversations led by Cassie and her family.</p><p>The important message, Jaya and Suneeta want to deliver are:</p><p>Never stop asking,</p><p>Keep on believing,</p><p>It’s all about learning,</p><p>Just keep on wondering,</p><p>Passionately pursuing,</p><p>All your Curiosities!</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=books class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Books</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Curious Cassie series has following book published till date:</p><hr><ul><li><a href=#curious-cassies-beach-ride-quest>Curious Cassie&rsquo;s beach ride quest</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id=curious-cassies-beach-ride-quest>Curious Cassie&rsquo;s beach ride quest</h2><p><strong>Title</strong>: Curious Cassie&rsquo;s beach ride quest: A Celebration of Isaac Newton&rsquo;s Discoveries</p><p><strong>Genre</strong>: Children’s Fiction (picture books, junior fiction)</p><p><strong>Publication date</strong>: 11-12-2022</p><p><img src=images/curious_cassie_beach_ride.jpeg alt="Curious Cassie&amp;rsquo;s beach ride quest!"></p><p>A curious and engaging conversation between Cassie, Caleb, and their mum as they head to the beach and encounter various circumstances touching upon the phenomena of motion and gravity and are left inspired by Sir Isaac Newton.</p><p><strong>Brief plot</strong>:</p><p>Cassie is a curious 6-years old child. She loves thinking and asking interesting questions. She is enthusiastically supported by her mum who refuses to miss any opportunity to draw inspiration from the great philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, and socialists of our times. By doing so, the mum hopes to inspire her kids to be curious and encourages them to continue pursuing their curiosity quest. Today, Cassie is heading to the beach with her mum and brother. Cassie wonders why the wattle tree in her backyard can’t move. The kids get incredibly excited as mum explains why followed by a fun fact about a special kind of tree that can move! They then talk about gravity and experience it through fun bunny hop exercises before hopping into the car for the drive to the beach. As they begin driving, they make a series of curious observations covering the concepts of distance, time, speed, and car wheel circumference. They then observe interesting phenomena of relative speeds and run a few experiments by tossing a ball in the air as they drive. They are thrilled to note that where the ball falls depends on the relative speed of the car. They are finally left inspired by Sir Isaac Newton as mum tells them that all the questions they asked today were similar to the questions asked by Sir Newton. She reminds them of pursuing their curiosity quest just like Sir Newton.</p><hr></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=contributors class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Contributors</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Jaya and Suneeta are your contributors to bringing Curious Cassie to life! In August 2022, they were driving through a motorway discussing how electronic devices, such as phones and tablets, are taking the &ldquo;think&rdquo; time away from our kids - the time when they become curious and go on explorations. That&rsquo;s when we planted the seed of book series to get inspired by great scientists and philosophers of our past and present to inspire the future ones ♥‿♥!</p><hr><h6 id=author>Author</h6><p><img src=images/suneeta-mall.png alt="Suneeta Mall"></p><p>Suneeta is an Australian citizen currently living in the greater Sydney area.

She is a software developer by profession. She is inspired by the questions of her 7 year old twin daughters. She feels that a lot needs to be done in order to maintain the inquisitiveness of young children and provide them with suitable resources. It gives her immense joy when she is able to teach children about numbers or how things work. She also loves to draw and paint, when her friend Suneeta came up with the idea of this book, she immediately wanted to be a part of it, because for her this book is a perfect combination of teaching children STEM concepts and visual representations of those concepts.</p><p><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i> <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaya-gajjar-39767917/>jaya-gajjar-39767917</a>
