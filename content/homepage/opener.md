The discoveries led by the scientists of our past and present continue to inspire us. These folks are curious and passionate about their quest. They are also fearless in asking questions.

In fact, [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), one of the great scientists of all time, once said, 
> I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious!


The [contributors of the Curious Cassie books](https://curiouscassie.github.io/#author) aim to tell you all about the great things our scientists discovered and invented through a series of fascinating tales! Both Suneeta and Jaya, the author and illustrator respectively, feel the need for more books that spark curiosity in the kids and encourage them to ask questions and follow through with their quests. Being closely connected to science and engineering, they feel perhaps there are better ways to get our younger 6-8 age kids to start thinking about STEM and being inspired by great scientists and philosophers of all times.

The Curious Cassie book series aims to address that. Cassie, a 6-year-old kid, is also passionately curious and not scared of asking questions! Every book in this series is devoted to a scientist whose discoveries are canvassed through fun and engaging conversations led by Cassie and her family.

The important message, Jaya and Suneeta want to deliver are: 


Never stop asking, 

Keep on believing, 

Itâ€™s all about learning,

Just keep on wondering, 

Passionately pursuing,

All your Curiosities!
