A curious and engaging conversation between Cassie, Caleb, and their mum as they head to the beach and encounter various circumstances touching upon the phenomena of motion and gravity and are left inspired by Sir Isaac Newton.


**Brief plot**:

Cassie is a curious 6-years old child. She loves thinking and asking interesting questions. She is enthusiastically supported by her mum who refuses to miss any opportunity to draw inspiration from the great philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, and socialists of our times. By doing so, the mum hopes to inspire her kids to be curious and encourages them to continue pursuing their curiosity quest. Today, Cassie is heading to the beach with her mum and brother. Cassie wonders why the wattle tree in her backyard can’t move. The kids get incredibly excited as mum explains why followed by a fun fact about a special kind of tree that can move! They then talk about gravity and experience it through fun bunny hop exercises before hopping into the car for the drive to the beach. As they begin driving, they make a series of curious observations covering the concepts of distance, time, speed, and car wheel circumference. They then observe interesting phenomena of relative speeds and run a few experiments by tossing a ball in the air as they drive. They are thrilled to note that where the ball falls depends on the relative speed of the car. They are finally left inspired by Sir Isaac Newton as mum tells them that all the questions they asked today were similar to the questions asked by Sir Newton. She reminds them of pursuing their curiosity quest just like Sir Newton.
