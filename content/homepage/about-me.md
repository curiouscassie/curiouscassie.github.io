![Suneeta Mall](images/suneeta-mall.png)

Suneeta is an Australian citizen currently living in the greater Sydney area. She is the mother of a 6-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy. 

Academically, Suneeta holds a Ph.D. in applied science from the University of Sydney and has a computer science engineering background. Professionally she is employed in the IT industry and is passionate about solving real-world problems with engineering, data, science, and machine learning. 

In her spare time, she authors for O'Reilly and Towards data science blogs. She also maintains her website http://suneeta-mall.github.io. 

Suneeta feels the need for more books that sparks curiosity in the kids and encourages them to ask questions and follow through with their quest. Being closely connected to science and engineering, she feels perhaps there are better ways to get our younger 6-8 age kids to start thinking about STEM and being inspired by great scientists and philosophers of all the times. This is where Curious Cassie comes in.

![Jaya Jha](images/Jaya-Jha.jpeg)

Jaya is passionate about education and arts. She is a software developer by profession. She is inspired by the questions of her 7 year old twin daughters. She feels that a lot needs to be done in order to maintain the inquisitiveness of young children and provide them with suitable resources. It gives her immense joy when she is able to teach children about numbers or how things work. She also loves to draw and paint, when her friend Suneeta came up with the idea of this book, she immediately wanted to be a part of it, because for her this book is a perfect combination of teaching children STEM concepts and visual representations of those concepts.
